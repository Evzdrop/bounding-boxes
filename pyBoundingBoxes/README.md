bounding-boxes
==============

A collection of simple scripts for producing Gnip bounding boxes for a study area.  Gnip bounding boxes have a 
25-mile per 'side' limit.  So these scripts could be used to produce 25-mile bounding boxes for a large area such
as Coloroado.

Currently there are scripts written in Ruby and Python.
